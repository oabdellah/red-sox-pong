# Final Softdes Project - Red Sox Pong Game
This is a game inspired by Red Sox game. Therefore, we decide to create a pong game intended to provide an interactive online game that allow players to get an idea of the red sox game. This game requires two player. You get two mode of games, the classic and the collaborative. The classic scores everytime the opposing player wasn't able to hit the paddle under a limit time while collaborative scores when you manage the hit the pong with the paddle.

In order to install this program, make sure to have pygame install. We mainly use this library to create and run our game. The game.py contains the necessary codes to see the homepage. To run the game, execute the main.py file and you can then enjoy the game.
